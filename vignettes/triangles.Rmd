Size and shading allow a single value to be displayed for each area unit. In order to display categorical data, we divide each hex into six triangles and aim to assign $[6p]$ triangles to a category with proportion $p$ of the total.  Simply rounding $6p$ to the nearest integer does not guarantee that the number of triangles assigned will add up to six; we use the Webster/Saint-LaguÃ« algorithm to allocate exactly six triangles. This is the same idea as used for hexbin scatterplots in the `hextri` package.


These triangle maps are superficially related to pie charts, but they do not share the deficiencies of pie charts.  The standard objection to pie charts is the difficulty of judging angles; in these triangle maps the angles are discrete and the number of possibilities is small, so counting triangles is fast and reliable. Conversely, an important limitation of the triangular subdivisions is their discreteness: they cannot display a category with probability 1/12th or less. More generally, they will be biased according to whether the category proportion is rounded up or down. 

We have 

- a function `tri_alloc()` for allocating triangles based on category counts
- base-R functions `dhbtri()` and `regiontri()`
- ggplot2 functions `geom_dhb_tri` and `geom_region_tri()`

The base-R functions work on *wide* format data, with a six-column matrix giving the triangle assignments.  The `ggplot2` geoms work on *long* format data, with a single column of colours and an identifier to map them to triangles.

### Car ownership by DHB

We have data on car ownership in the District Health Board areas, from Stats New Zealand. 

```{r}
library(DHBins)
data(dhb_cars)
head(dhb_cars)
```

The first step is to allocate triangles

```{r}
tris<-tri_alloc(dhb_cars[,-1], c("0","1","2","3+"), names=dhb_cars$dhb )
tri_data<-data.frame(DHB=rep(rownames(tris),6),
                     cars=as.vector(tris),
		     tri_id=rep(1:6,each=nrow(tris)))
head(tris)
```

Now use `ggplot` to

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=9}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(tri_data)+
	geom_dhbtri(aes(map_id=DHB,class_id=tri_id, fill=cars),alpha=0.5)+
	scale_fill_viridis_d()+
	geom_label_dhb(short=TRUE, size=4)
```

### Ethnicity by Region

The data on ethnicity come from the Census, now for the Regions.  For the benefit of non-NZ people, the "MELAA" group is Middle East, Latin America, and Africa", essentially, "Other".

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=9}
data(region_ethnicity)
tri_eth<-tri_alloc(as.matrix(region_ethnicity[,-1]),
	classes=c("Asian","Euro","Maori","MELAA","Pacific"),
	names=region_ethnicity$Area)


tri_data<-data.frame(Region=rep(rownames(tri_eth),6),
                     ethnicity=as.vector(tri_eth),
		     tri_id=rep(1:6,each=nrow(tri_eth)))

ggplot(tri_data)+
	geom_regiontri(aes(map_id=Region,class_id=tri_id, fill=ethnicity))+
	geom_label_region(colour="Black", short=TRUE,cex=3)
```
